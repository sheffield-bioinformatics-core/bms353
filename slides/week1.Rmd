- Dr. Mark Dunning - Module Coordinator
  + sbc.shef.ac.uk/team/mark
- Bsc and Msc; Maths and Computer Science - York
- PhD Bioinformatics; - Cambridge
- Bioinformatics Core Analyst and Trainer;  Cancer Research Uk
- Bioinformatics Core Lead;  Sheffield

## Course Materials

- Course Website
  + https://sbc.shef.ac.uk/bms353
- Video recordings via blackboard
- Pre-materials each week


## Teaching format

- Short intro lecture and pre-material videos
- Live online sessions with module coordinator and demonstrators
  + working through RStudio code and solving problems
  + small breakout groups with demonstrators to answer questions
- Solutions available to check your work
- Assignment at the end
  + analysis of a real-life dataset
  
## Course Aims

- *make students aware of effects of experimental design*
- *good understanding of technologies and methods for Bioinformatics*
- *introduce basic coding in R*

## Course Aims - specifics

- Walk through RNA-seq workflow in R
  + quality assessment
  + differential expression
  + visualisation
  + downstream analysis
- By the end you should have a reproducible report for the above analysis

## Course Aims - high-level

- Creating reproducible reports
  + not just showing the answer - but how you got to it
- Getting stuck, and figuring out how to solve errors
- Interpreting and questioning data

## Prior knowledge

- Rstudio and the tidyverse packages
  + dplyr
  + ggplot2
- RNA-seq workflow
  + in Galaxy
- sbc.shef.ac.uk/bms397

## Why R?

- Reputation
- Interactivity
- Flexibility
- Support
- **Reproducibility**
