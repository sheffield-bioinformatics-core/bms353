# About 

## Pre-material

We will assume you have a basic familiarity with the R language and Rstudio and are reasonably confident in performing the following tasks:-

- Creating new RStudio projects and markdown files
- Importing spreadsheets into R
- Filtering, arranging and selecting with `dplyr`
- Plotting using `ggplot2`

You should also be familiar with the
